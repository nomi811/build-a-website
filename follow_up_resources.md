# Taster Weekend Resources

Hi all!

It was so great to meet you all this weekend. Please see a list of resources
below that I have personally curated to help you in your journey of becoming a
Programmer. Naturally there is a lot to get through here; I would recommend
picking one language and sticking with it until you are feeling confident that
you can do the basics, before delving into another.

If you need any more information, please do not hesitate to contact us, and we
will do all we can to point you in the right direction.

Happy Coding,

Roi

## Setting Up Your Dev Environment

* [Prepare to Code]([http://www.preparetocode.io](http://www.preparetocode.io/)-
  this guide includes all the steps you might need to set up your Mac to become
a Ruby Dev. Make sure you install the technologies in order, from right to left.
A quick summary of the tech you will be installing:
    *  Xcode Command Line Tools - useful because it installs a
       [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) which
gives access to many UNIX-based applications.
    *  Homebrew - this is what's called a ['package
       manager'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) - basically it
makes it easy for you to install things!
    *  RVM & Ruby - Ruby is already installed on a Mac, but Ruby Version Manager
       (RVM) is a way to conveniently switch between versions of the language to
accomodate different projects. Essential for working on a wide variety of Ruby
projects.
    *  PRY - an alternative to
       [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell) with syntax
highlighting and a plethora of other features which make debugging much more
enjoyable.
    *  Heroku Toolbelt - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a hosting service
       you will be familiar with after completing the MA Taster Weekend.
Installing Heroku's toolbelt will give you command line access to their
fantastic platform!

* [Oh My ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/) - If you fire up your terminal, you'll notice
  that you are using the shell langage
[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) to interact with your
system. While this is all well and good, we find many of our full-time students
switch to ZSH because it offers many exciting features. They tend to do this by
installing Oh My ZSH - quite possibly because it allows you to easily switch
between some very pretty-looking themes...
* [Iterm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - This replacement for Mac's own Terminal
  program is THE way to fly if you're going to be spending time with your
command line. See a video demo
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJEN-GFSkrU).
* [Badassify Your Terminal and
  Shell](http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/) - A fantastic
article to make your experience using the command line infinitely more
pleasurable.

## Command Line

* [Command Line Cheat
  Sheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) - Cheat sheets
are indispensible for Developers, and so is learning how to interact with the
Command Line. So this is basically a two-for-one.
* [Unix 101](http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/unix_101.html) - Unix is the
  operating system that Mac's OS X is built on. By learning a little Unix, you
can go a long way...

## Ruby

Ruby is the main language at Makers Academy - we love it, and truly believe it
is the most beginner-friendly syntax whilst retaining industry relevance. Here
are some links to get you started:

* [Ruby Kickstart](https://vimeo.com/tag:ruby+kickstart) - Josh Cheek's set of
  video tutorials cut to the meat and get you where you need to be as quickly as
possible. Highly recommended.
* [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/) - Zed Shaw is
  opinionated, brash (and hates bootcamps!) But he has written an excellent set
of resources to get you off the ground in a variety of different technologies,
and for that we love him.


## Javascript

JavaScript is the language of the Web, and you're unlikely to be able to avoid
it, or it's insanely powerful properties. So to meet it head on:

* [JavaScript The Right Way](http://jstherightway.org/)
* [Superhero JS](http://superherojs.com/)
* [Must See JavaScript Dev Tools That Put Other Dev Tools to
  Shame](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/must-see-javascript-dev-tools-that-put-other-dev-tools-to-shame-aca6d3e3d925#.y5bittfal)

## Books

### Ruby

* [The Well Grounded
  Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-second-edition)
- a very comprehensive introduction to the language and beginner-friendly (just
  ignore the first chapter about libraries as it's rather dense.)

### JavaScript

* [Eloquent JavaScript](http://jstherightway.org/) 0 available in print, or
  online for free
* [JavaScript & jQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) - a fantastic book and
  particularly accessible to beginners.

### HTML & CSS

* [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) - by the creator of the
  [JavaScript & jQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) book. An excellent
introduction to coding for any beginner.
* [Handcrafted CSS](http://handcraftedcss.com/) - if you are wanting to write
  CSS that will last, this is the resource for you.


# Emotional Support

* [Are You Smart Enough To Be A
  Programmer?](http://devblog.avdi.org/2015/11/23/are-you-smart-enough-to-be-a-programmer/)
