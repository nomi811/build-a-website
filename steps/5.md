# Making things happen with JavaScript

Our website doesn't do very much yet.  We're going to change that now using JavaScript.  JavaScript is not just another programming language; it is unique because - currently - it is the only language *that can run in the browser*.  That might not mean much to you right now, but it's a game changer!  It means we can load code into our pages from various sources - not just our own server - and have it run independently on the client's machine.

If you think that sounds potentially dangerous, you are right.  A large number of Internet security vulnerabilities involve JavaScript.  However, without JavaScript, the web would be a much duller place.

We'll be using two external JavaScrpt libraries: [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Google Image Search](https://developers.google.com/image-search/?hl=en) (which is actually no longer supported, but it still works).

We need to tell our page to load these two JavaScript libraries from somewhere.  Fortunately, they can be loaded directly across the Internet.  Add the following two lines to the `<head>` element of your `index.erb`:

```html
<script src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
```

These two libraries won't do anything on their own, we need to write our own JavaScript to interact with them.  Let's begin by creating the folder `public/javascripts`.  Create two files inside it: `support.js` and `application.js`.

The first file, `support.js` will contain some JavaScript we've already written for this project (think of it as a library). It's slightly more complicated than the other stuff, so we'll leave it until the end.  For now, simply copy and paste (just this once!) the contents from [this file](/support/support.js) into your `support.js`. Leave `application.js` empty for the moment.

Add the following two lines to the `<head>` element of your `index.erb` to reference the new files:

```html
<script src="/javascripts/support.js"></script>
<script src="/javascripts/application.js"></script>
```

Your `<head>` element should now look something like this:

```html
<head>
  <link href="/css/application.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  <script src="https://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/javascripts/support.js"></script>
  <script src="/javascripts/application.js"></script>
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
```

Make sure everything is saved then try loading the page.  If you load the page outside of Cloud9 (e.g. in a different browser tab), you can use the browser's developer tools to check there are no errors on the page.  If there are, you may have to fix them before going any further.  Following is an example showing the page opened in a separate tab with the Google Chrome developer console reporting an error:

![JavaScript error loading support.js](/images/step_5/js_error_loading_file.png)

Close inspection of the error should reveal that the URL for `support.js` is incorrect in this example; it should be `/javascripts/` not `/javascript/`.  **404 errors** are a common occurrence and are often the result of a typo!

Assuming you've got everything working, let's move on to adding code in `application.js`.  We've got some code in `support.js` that interacts with the Google Image Search API, now we need to call it when the search form is submitted.  We're going to use the JQuery library for this as it simplifies the JavaScript we need to write.  Remember: we're loading the JQuery library in this line `<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script>`.

> JQuery is a powerful JavaScript library providing a number of utilities and a standardized way to interact with elements on the page.  When you 'write JQuery', it's still pure JavaScript, but you are calling functions and objects from the JQuery library.

Add the following to `application.js`:

```javascript
$(document).on('submit', '#search-form', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  var options = {
    keywords: $('#search-term').val(),
    container: $('#search-results')
  };
  findImagesOnGoogle(options);
});
```

You'll have to be careful typing that in.  JavaScript is not always a pretty language, with lots of `()`, `{}`, `,` and `;` getting in the way.  Unfortunately, with the exception of the odd semicolon, they're all essential.  But you'll get used to it.

Let's break this code down into pieces so it's easier to understand.  First, we want to respond to the user 'submitting' the form, which happens when they click the 'Go!' button, or press 'Enter' in the search text box.  The browser handles that for us automatically and reports that an **event** has occurred.  JQuery provides a convenient syntax for responding (**handling**) that event:

```javascript
$(document).on(event, selector, handler);
```
Where:
* `event` is the name of the event.  For form submissions, the event name is `submit`.
* `selector` is a string (in the same format as a **CSS selector**) that specifies which element the event should happen on.
* `handler` is a function that contains the code to run when the event happens on the selected element.

So, applying that to our page, we would have:
```javascript
$(document).on('submit', '#search-form', function(e) { ...our code needs to go here...  });
```

`#search-form` means 'the element with `id="search-form"`'.  To make space for our code, we break the above onto multiple lines:

```javascript
$(document).on('submit', '#search-form', function(e) {
  // ...some code needs to go here...
});
```

Now, what do we want to happen? We want to search Google Images for a given keyword and show the results.  We have a function `findImagesOnGoogle` that we can call, but we need to pass it some options:

```javascript
var options = {
  keywords: $('#search-term').val(),
  container: $('#search-results')
};
```

This creates an object (in a variable called `options`), with a property called `keywords` and a property called `container` (which is what our function `findImagesOnGoogle` requires).

Remember, our text field has an id of `search-term`:
```html
<input id="search-term" type="text">
```

It has the `id="search-term"`, so we can reference it using JQuery and the CSS selector format again:

```javascript
$('#search-term').val()
```

This code means *Take the element with id of 'search-term' and return its value (i.e. what's typed inside)*.

Where do we put the results? Remember we created a special area for them?:

```html
<div id="search-results"></div>
```

As you can probably guess by now, we can reference this area like this:

```javascript
$("#search-results")
```

Now we have everything we need to get the images from Google and show the results.

```javascript
var options = {
  keywords: $('#search-term').val(),
  container: $('#search-results')
};
findImagesOnGoogle(options);
```

So what about the `e.preventDefault()` bit?  We'll leave that for another time.  Here's the full code again for you to peruse:

```javascript
$(document).on('submit', '#search-form', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  var options = {
    keywords: $('#search-term').val(),
    container: $('#search-results')
  };
  findImagesOnGoogle(options);
});
```

Make sure everything is saved and refresh your browser.  Enter a search term and you'll see the results!

Impressive, isn't it? Especially given how little work we actually had to do to achieve this result.

It's still not pretty, but we'll fix that soon.
